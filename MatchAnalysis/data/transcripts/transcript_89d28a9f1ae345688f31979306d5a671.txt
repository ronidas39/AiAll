<Person1> "Welcome to daily post match summary! Cricket season is going on! And what a match we have for you today, folks! West Indies pulling off a stunning victory against Bangladesh in the third ODI, completing a clean sweep of the series.  Amazing stuff, isn't it?"
</Person1><Person2> "Absolutely thrilling!  A 322-run chase?  You don't see that every day, especially against a Bangladesh side that put up a very respectable 321.  Four fifties in their innings – they really brought the fight.”
</Person2><Person1> "They certainly did. But the star of the show, hands down, has to be debutant Amir Jangoo.  A century on debut!  104 not out, guiding his team to victory. Talk about a dream start to an international career.    It's been…what,  almost five decades since a West Indian achieved that?"
</Person1><Person2> "46 years to be exact!  And he didn't just score runs, he paced the chase brilliantly.  That partnership with Keacy Carty – 132 runs for the fifth wicket – was crucial.  And then another unbeaten 91-run stand with Gudakesh Motie to seal the deal!   Real nail-biter until the very end. " 
</Person2><Person1> "Oh, um, absolutely! Motie played his part too – 44 off 31 balls, three sixes, three fours.  Real firepower down the order.  But I think Carty deserves a lot of credit too.  95 runs, held the innings together when they were in a spot of bother.”
</Person1><Person2> "You're right,  Keacy Carty played a brilliant supporting role to Jangoo's heroics.   But let's not forget Bangladesh’s innings. Mahmudullah and Jaker Ali’s unbeaten 150-run partnership for the sixth wicket – a Bangladesh record! They really pushed the West Indies.  Twelve sixes in the innings – almost took the game away." 
</Person2><Person1> "Yeah, interesting. You know, it's these little moments that can shift the momentum of a match.  Remember that dropped catch?  Jangoo miscued one, and the substitute fielder, Parvez Hossain Emon…  Just couldn't hold on. That could have been a turning point." 
</Person1><Person2> " Definitely a costly miss!   Rishad Hossain got Carty out the very next ball, but… the damage was done.  Jangoo capitalized on that second chance. I mean, who knows what could’ve happened otherwise?" 
</Person2><Person1> "Exactly!  I see.   And Brandon King,  another quick start, but a run out early on. Those things happen in the heat of the moment, I suppose. But yeah, great series for him overall.”
</Person1><Person2> "A bittersweet ending for him, perhaps.   But this West Indies team,  they’ve really shown some grit.  Chasing down 300+ scores isn’t easy, and they’ve done it four times now in ODIs.  This win, this series…  A real statement of intent." 
</Person2><Person1> "Couldn't agree more. A stunning performance from the West Indies, capped off by a truly memorable debut from Amir Jangoo.  This series win will give them a lot of confidence going forward. Thanks for joining us for the post-match analysis, folks.  Until next time, goodbye!" </Person1>
